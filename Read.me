1. Augmented Reality with PyTorch3D and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a basic augmented reality application that overlays a synthetic 3D object onto a real-world image. The core of the project involves calculating the camera's position and orientation from a 2D image and then using that information to render a 3D model with the correct perspective.

Features
* Camera Pose Estimation**: Determines the 6DoF (6 Degrees of Freedom) pose of the camera from a single image.
* 3D Object Rendering**: Uses PyTorch3D to render a 3D mesh with a simple lighting model.
* Realistic Compositing**: Blends the synthetic object seamlessly with the real-world photograph.

How It Works
The process is a pipeline combining 2D computer vision with 3D computer graphics.

1. Camera Pose Estimation
To figure out where the camera is, we use **OpenCV's `solvePnP`** algorithm. This function is the key to connecting the 2D image to the 3D world.
* We first define the real-world measurements of a flat, rectangular object in the scene (e.g., "the object is 15cm x 15cm"). These are our **3D world points**.
* We then find the corresponding pixel locations of the object's corners in the 2D image. These are our **2D image points**.
* `solvePnP` takes these two sets of points and calculates the camera's **Rotation** ($R$) and **Translation** ($T$) relative to the object.

2. 3D Rendering and Compositing
Once we know the camera's pose, we use **PyTorch3D** to create the virtual scene.
* A virtual camera is created and placed at the exact pose ($R, T$) calculated in the previous step.
* A 3D mesh (the teapot) is loaded and positioned in the center of the real-world object's location.
* The `renderer` "takes a picture" of the 3D mesh from the virtual camera's perspective, creating a new image of the object with a transparent background.
* Finally, this rendered image is overlaid onto the original photograph using an **alpha mask** for seamless blending.

How to Run
This project is designed to run in a Google Colab notebook.

1.  **Open the Notebook**: Load the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2.  **Upload Your Image**: Upload a photo of a flat, rectangular object (like a book or a box) to the Colab session.
3.  **Configure the Script**: In the main code block, update the following variables:
    * `image_path`: Set this to the filename of your uploaded image.
    * `object_width_cm`, `object_height_cm`: Set these to the real-world measurements of your object.
    * `image_points_2d`: Update the array with the precise `(x, y)` pixel coordinates of your object's four corners.
4.  **Execute the Code**: Run the entire code cell to generate the final augmented reality image.
